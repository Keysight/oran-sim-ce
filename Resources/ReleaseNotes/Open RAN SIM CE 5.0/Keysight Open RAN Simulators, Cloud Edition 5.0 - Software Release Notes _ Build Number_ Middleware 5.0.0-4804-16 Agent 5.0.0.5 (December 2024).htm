    ORAN SIM CE 5.0 provides a new middleware image. Please note that upgrading a setup from previous versions is not supported.
    <br>
    ORAN SIM CE 5.0 also comes with new agent images and upgrades.
    <br>
    AWS and Azure images are not distributed on the product download 
page. Both (AWS and Azure) can be shared by request by the engineering 
team.
    Please contact engineering at email <a href="https://download.software.keysight.com/CMP/4/ORAN-SIM-CE/5.0/loadcore-support@keysighttech.onmicrosoft.com">LoadCore-Support</a> to
    request access to these images.
    <br>
    <br>
    The REST API dashboards names have been changed. For automation users, in case your harness is checking the
    statistics, please use the REST API stats migration script to automatically convert the old naming into the new one.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Please use the below steps to deploy ORAN SIM CE 5.0 OVA and configure an account
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Deploy the UI/middleware cluster OVA file</li>
        <li>Deploy the licensing OVA file (optional)</li>
        <li>After deployment you can access the UI using the MW machine IP and access it using a browser:
            https://XX.XX.XX.XX. If shortly after deploying the MW the UI is not accessible, you need to wait a couple
            of minutes for all the pods to start up.</li>
        <li>To access the UI, you will be prompted for a username and password. You will need to register a new user and
            then use it each time you log in.</li>

        <li>Connect to the ORAN SIM CE with your account.</li>
    </ol>
    

<h4>If ORAN SIM CE agents are not yet deployed, please use the below steps to deploy and configure</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Deploy the ORAN SIM CE 5.0 agent OVA file</li>
        <li>Add another NIC to the agent VM from the hypervisor configuration window. This will be the test NIC.</li>
        <li>Log in to the agent VM and configure the management interface, if needed</li>
        <li>Run the agent-setup.sh script and follow the steps in the interactive setup. This step is required to
            connect the agent to the middleware/UI cluster.</li>
        <pre>#  sudo ./agent-setup.sh</pre>
        <li>At this point, you should be able to see the newly created agent in the UI</li>
    </ol>
    Repeat these steps to deploy as many agents as required.
    <h4>If ORAN SIM CE 3.0 agents are deployed on Virtual Environments, please use the below steps to upgrade</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>After connecting to the ORAN SIM CE 5.0 MW, find the "Gear menu" in the upper right corner and click on it to bring up the menu</li>
        <li>Then, click on "Agent Management"</li>
        <li>Select the agents to be upgraded then click on "Update" button</li>
        <li>A new pop-up window is displayed. Click on the "Select 
update package for upload" button and find the upgrade tgz file on the 
disk</li>
        <li>Click on the "Start" button to apply the patch and wait for the procedure to end</li>
    </ol>

        <ul>

            <h3> Application Infrastructure </h3>
		<li>LoadCore configuration files generated in versions older than 
2.3.0 are no longer supported. In order to use such config files, the 
workaround is to import and export them into a LoadCore 2.3.0 or 3.0.0 
instance.</li>
            <li bugid="LOADCORE-1525">When checking license statistics, in the application column appears LoadCore N/A instead of LoadCore</li>
            <li bugid="LOADCORE-1514">When taking licenses from SLUM, instead of username, it appears an hexa code</li>
            <li bugid="LOADCORE-1590">Predefined flows are not working when the agent is connected to the MW without using the LoadBalancer public ip</li>
            <li bugid="BUG1546716">On SRIOV setups using Intel NIC we can use a maximum of 4 cores</li>
            <li bugid="">On SRIOV setups using Intel NIC, the recommendation is to use a MTU equal to 1480 when
                configuring VLANs on the N3 interface</li>
            <li>Deploying a new middleware, in rare occasions, fails because of the weavenet pod gives an error. The
                workaround is to delete the weavenet pod which will trigger the pod to be recreated correctly</li>
            <li bugid="BUG1558579"> Sometimes a test could fail to start with 'Lizard communication error' if the
                required agents were rebooted from UI before starting the test. As a workaround the user should wait for
                about a minute then start the test again.</li>
            <li bugid="BUG1561108"> Sometimes the LC MW becomes unavailable after a reboot. Workaround: reboot the LC MW
                again.</li>
            <li bugid="LoadCore-778"> Sometimes the LC MW UI hangs while it gets updated. Workaround: wait several
                minutes, refresh the UI and check the Keysight Load Core version.</li>
            <li bugid="LOADCORE-814"> The Per-UE Statistics feature only works with Stateless UDP flow. The Per-UE
                Statistics will show up as empty in UI if running an Application Traffic test. </li>
            <li bugid="LOADCORE-511"> The Per-UE Statistics feature is currently only supported for the NG-RAN
                application and will not generate CSVs for any other nodes when running a test with this feature. </li>
			<li bugid="LOADCORE-1475">The Process of updating LoadCore MDW from Web UI in a cloud environment might not reach the end.
                The workaround is to refresh the Web UI and check the new versions.</li>
            <li bugid="LOADCORE-2286">Reserved subnets ( e.g 169.254.0.0) are not supported for management communication </li>
            <li bugid="ISGAPPSEC2-24079">On License Server the search bar from license statistics is not working. The workaround is to manually search the strings </li>
