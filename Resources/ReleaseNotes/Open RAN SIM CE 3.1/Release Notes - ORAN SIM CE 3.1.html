<b>ORAN SIM CE 3.1</b> is an update built upon ORAN SIM CE 3.0, and it requires the prior installation of CE 3.0.
    <BR>
    <BR>
Key updates in CE 3.1 include the introduction of the CU isolation topology, enabling a wraparound configuration with either DUSim and CoreSIM or DUSim and DN. Additionally, enhancements have been made across several components: 
		<LI>Infrastructure: Added support for IPv6 and IPv4v6 management addresses.</LI>
		<LI>User Plane now supports running IxStack DPDK in containers for Telco Cloud worker images.</LI>
		<LI>LoadCore: Introduced Gx interface support for 4G standalone core, alongside various other feature enhancements.</LI>
		<LI>DUSim: New control plane procedures added.</LI>
		<LI>CUSim: Added support for HTTPS.</LI>
		<LI>CoreSIM: Enhanced with MDT settings.</LI>
	<BR>
This update strengthens the platform’s infrastructure, user plane, and component functionality, improving overall flexibility and performance.

            of minutes for all the pods to start up.</LI>
        <LI>To access the UI, you will be prompted for a username and password. You will need to register a new user and
